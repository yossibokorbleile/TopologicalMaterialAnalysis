# Topological Material Analysis (ToMA) is released under a GPL license. You should have received a [copy](LICENSE.md) of this when you downloaded this repository.

# ToMA is dependent on Oineus and Diode to handle a lot of the "under the hood" functionalities.
#
# There are two ways you can use Amorphous Material Analysis:
# -# Graphical User Interface (default)
# -# Command Line Interface
#    
# both of which have several different modes:
# -# single
# -# multi
# -# batch
#
# In the GUI, these are selected at startup, and for the CLI, the mode to be used is set in a settings file with an INI format. To use `ToMA` in the CLI mode, run 
#`./ToMA.py -i c -s $SETTINGS FILE`.
#
# Information about the packages required and instructions for the settings files are in the [README](README.md).

Currently, it uses [Oineus](https://github.com/anigmetov/oineus) and [Diode](https://github.com/mrzv/diode) under the hood to take care of some calculations and processing of the data. As such, it is currently licensed under a GNU GPL license, which you can view from the [License](/License) page in the side bar.")
